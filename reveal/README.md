# Reveal

A social media site for local burlesque communities. Burlesque performers and event organizers rely on social media for promotion and engagement, but there are several problems with existing mainstream platforms:

    1. Over-moderation: Users are often shadowbanned or suspended for posting risqu√© content, even when that content is not explicit and is within the platform's TOS.

    2. Fragmentation: Performers and organizers must use several different social media sites for promotion. This can be difficult to manage.

    3. Poor discoverability: Existing search functionalities are lacking, making it a challenge to find local events. Several communities have resorted to keeping a plain text Google Doc of all upcoming shows in their area. Not only must these lists be manually maintained, they are not visually appealing and do little to entice audience interest.

Reveal aims to address these pain points by providing a network specifically designed for the burlesque world.
