# Reveal

## Overview & Problem

Reveal is a social media site built especially for local burlesque communities. Burlesque performers and event organizers rely on social media for promotion and engagement, but there are several problems with the existing mainstream platforms:

    1. Over-moderation: Users are often shadowbanned or suspended for posting risqu√© content, even when that content is not explicit and is within the platform's TOS.

    2. Fragmentation: Performers and organizers must use several different social media sites for promotion. This can be difficult to manage.

    3. Poor discoverability: Existing search functionalities are lacking, making it a challenge to find local events. Several communities have resorted to keeping a plain text Google Doc of all upcoming shows in their area. Not only must these lists be manually maintained, they are not visually appealing and do little to encourage ticket sales.

Reveal aims to address these pain points by providing a network specifically designed for the burlesque world.

## User Profile

Burlesque performers of all experience levels may be Reveal's most important users, but they will not be the only ones. Producers and venue owners will be able to use Reveal to recruit performers and promote their upcoming events. Burlesque fans can follow their favourite artists, revisit the best moments of shows they've been to with photo and video galleries, and discover enticing events to go to next. Finally, the "burlesque-curious" will find Reveal to be a repository of information and inspiration, as well as a natural medium to connect with local mentors and schools should they dream of getting on stage themselves!
